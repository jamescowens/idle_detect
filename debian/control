Description: System and User services to detect user idle time and activity
 This package provides two services for monitoring user activity on Linux systems,
 primarily intended for controlling background tasks like Distributed Computing
 (e.g., BOINC).
 .
  * event_detect: A system service that monitors low-level input devices (mice),
    TTY access times, and messages from idle_detect instances via a named pipe.
    It provides an aggregated 'last active time' via shmem or file.
  * idle_detect: A user service that detects graphical session idle time using
    X11 (XScreenSaver), KDE D-Bus (ksmserver), or GNOME D-Bus (Mutter) methods,
    accounting for application inhibitions where possible (currently KDE). It can
    report activity to event_detect and optionally run commands on state changes.
  .
  Note: The user service component (idle_detect) requires manual setup via
  the accompanying user_install.sh script after package installation.
