<div class="textblock"><p>This is an effort to provide a compact C++ library to detect user activity on a workstation for the purpose of running commands when the idle/active state changes. It is motivated primarily to solve the idle detection issues with BOINC and other Linux based DC programs. I am implementing the following architecture, as a separate service independent of any particular DC architecture. Note that I did a proof of concept in bash shell script, and am currently very near completion on the C++ implementation. Event_detect is finished and the idle_detect C++ version is operational and being tested and fine-tuned.</p>
<p>Note the C++ is implemented in modern C++-17 compliant code, in an object oriented manner. It also is multithreaded with appropriate locking/critical section control.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a system level (via a dedicated system account event_detect) service, event_detect, run in a tightly controlled systemd service, dc_event_detection.service, that checks three things for idle time:<ul>
<li>the /dev/input/event devices that are pointing devices. (This catches all phyiscal mouse movement.)</li>
<li>the pts/tty devices for atime (which provides idle time for terminals/pseudo terminals, including ssh sessions.)</li>
<li>an input event via a named-pipe from user level detector (more on that below)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The output of the event_detect is a shared memory segment /idle_detect_shmem and/or a file last_active_time.dat, which is in /run/event_detect. Note that on all reasonably recent Linux distributions, the /run directory is a tmpfs which is in memory only. The shared memory consists of a two element array of int64_t's that is the timestamp of the update and the last_active_time in Unix epoch seconds UTC. Similarly, the ONLY thing written to the last_active_time.dat is an int64 in string format that represents unix epoch time in seconds UTC.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is a user level service, idle_detect, run as a user level systemd service (i.e. systemctl &ndash;user ...) that does the following things:<ul>
<li>determines the session type, i.e. tty (non GUI), then whether kde.</li>
<li>for tty based session, uses event_detect.</li>
<li>If KDE, both X and Wayland provide idle time with inhibit propagation via org.kde.ksmserver GetSessionIdleTime. A session inhibit imposed by a movie application here causes the idle time to reset to zero every few seconds.</li>
<li>If not KDE, then via CheckGnomeInhibition() check org.gnome.SessionManager.IsInhibited which determines inhibition on both Wayland and X Gnome sessions. If not inhibited get Gnome idle time via mutter. If not Gnome get idle time from XSS. Note that the fallback strategy here means that essentially for non-KDE non-Gnome window managers, XSS and/or fallback to event_detect will be used, which means that idle inhibit functionality will be lost.</li>
<li>reports the combined last_active_time from all of the above (unless it fell back to USING event_detect) by writing to the named pipe set up by event_detect a short message in the form of timestamp:USER_ACTIVE, which is received by an asynchronous, non-blocking read thread on the event_detect side, which does validation on the message to prevent a security risk.</li>
<li>optionally can run dc control scripts itself to control dc programs directly based on idle time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since event_detect receives update last_active_times from its own sources AND all user level idle_detect instances running on the machine, and provides an overall last_active_time in last_active_time.dat, the BOINC client or other DC architecture can simply poll the last_idle_time.dat file once a second to determine idleness.</p>
<p>This resolves 99% of the issues we have been having with idle detection. Other specific window manager code can be added later for idle inhibit detection on other than KDE/Gnome.</p>
<p>This should be considered early beta code. It should run stably. Most corner cases have been tested, but installation is still not straigtforward.</p>
<p>Development work is occurring on the development branch, and releases are on master. I am currently doing periodic pre-release tags (i.e. 0.x) at significant development points.</p>

<h3>Current dependencies (both library and development files - for compilation):</h3>
<ul>
<li>libevdev</li>
<li>libXss</li>
<li>dbus-1</li>
<li>glib-2.0</li>
<li>gobject-2.0</li>
<li>gio-2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev packages needed to compile for Ubuntu:</p><ul>
<li>libevdev-dev</li>
<li>libxss-dev</li>
<li>libdbus-1-dev</li>
<li>libglib2.0-dev</li>
</ul>
<p>Fedora:</p><ul>
<li>libevdev-devel</li>
<li>libX11-devel</li>
<li>libXScrnSaver-devel</li>
<li>dbus-devel</li>
<li>glib2-devel</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installation procedure</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>git clone <a href="https://github.com/jamescowens/idle_detect.git">https://github.com/jamescowens/idle_detect.git</a> and change into the idle_detect directory.</li>
<li>Make sure you have installed the packages for the dependences listed above. The actual names will vary depending on the distribution.</li>
<li>Compile and install the executables and system level service event_detect and config file with sudo ./install.sh. Two arguments can be supplied to install.sh: &ndash;prefix=&lt;prefix directory&gt; to change the installation prefix directory from the default of /usr/local/bin, and &ndash;cxx-compiler=&lt;compiler path&gt; to specify the path of a C++-17 compliant compiler. Note that the cmake install script run by install.sh will do a compile test to ensure the chosen compiler supports the C++-17 features used in this code, as some compilers report C++-17 compatible and accept the flag, but in fact do not fully implement all parts of the C++-17 standard. Gcc-7 is a good example.</li>
<li>Modify event_detect.conf to your liking with sudo nano /etc/event_detect.conf and if you changed the event_detect.conf file, reload the service with sudo systemctl restart dc_event_detection.</li>
<li>Install user level script and user level service with ./user_install.sh (This is run as your regular user account, not sudo.)</li>
<li>Modify idle_detect.conf to your liking with nano ~/.config/idle_detect.conf and reload the service with systemctl &ndash;user restart dc_idle_detection.</li>
<li>Check the status of both the services: sudo systemctl status dc_event_detection, and systemctl &ndash;user status dc_idle_detection, and make sure they are successfully running.</li>
<li>Modify the dc_pause and dc_unpause scripts to your liking (they are currently set up to control BOINC in its default installation).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>sudo nano /usr/local/bin/dc_pause</li>
<li>sudo nano /usr/local/bin/dc_unpause</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>If you make subsequent changes to the event_detect.conf file or the idle_detect.conf files, then you currently need to restart the appropriate service to pick up the changes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>This is early beta level code and is currently subject to rapid change.</h3>
