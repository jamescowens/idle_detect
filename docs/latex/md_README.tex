This is an effort to provide a compact C++ library to detect user activity on a workstation for the purpose of running commands when the idle/active state changes. It is motivated primarily to solve the idle detection issues with B\+O\+I\+NC and other Linux based DC programs. I am implementing the following architecture as a separate service independent of any particular DC architecture. One would hope logind in systemd would eventually fulfill this role, but as of now it does not correctly report the idle state of sessions. Note that I did a proof of concept in bash shell script, the last versions of which are in the deprecated folder for reference, and am currently very near completion on the C++ implementation. Event\+\_\+detect is finished and the idle\+\_\+detect C++ version is operational and being tested and fine-\/tuned.

Note the C++ is implemented in modern C++-\/17 compliant code, in an object oriented manner. It also is multi-\/threaded with appropriate locking/critical section control.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item There is a system level (via a dedicated system account event\+\_\+detect) service, event\+\_\+detect, run in a tightly controlled systemd service, dc\+\_\+event\+\_\+detection.\+service, that checks three things for idle time\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the /dev/input/event devices that are pointing devices. (This catches all physical mouse movement.)
\item the pts/tty devices for atime (which provides idle time for terminals/pseudo terminals, including ssh sessions.)
\item an input event via a named-\/pipe from user level detector (more on that below)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The output of the event\+\_\+detect is a shared memory segment /idle\+\_\+detect\+\_\+shmem and/or a file last\+\_\+active\+\_\+time.\+dat, which is in /run/event\+\_\+detect. Note that on all reasonably recent Linux distributions, the /run directory is a tmpfs which is in memory only. The shared memory consists of a two element array of int64\+\_\+t\textquotesingle{}s that is the timestamp of the update and the last\+\_\+active\+\_\+time in Unix epoch seconds U\+TC. Similarly, the O\+N\+LY thing written to the last\+\_\+active\+\_\+time.\+dat is an int64 in string format that represents Unix epoch time in seconds U\+TC.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item There is a user level service, idle\+\_\+detect, run as a user level systemd service (i.\+e. systemctl --user ...) that does the following things\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item determines the session type, i.\+e. tty (non G\+UI), then whether kde.
\item for tty based session, uses event\+\_\+detect.
\item If K\+DE, both X and Wayland provide idle time with inhibit propagation via org.\+kde.\+ksmserver Get\+Session\+Idle\+Time. A session inhibit imposed by a movie application here causes the idle time to reset to zero every few seconds.
\item If not K\+DE, then via Check\+Gnome\+Inhibition() check org.\+gnome.\+Session\+Manager.\+Is\+Inhibited which determines inhibition on both Wayland and X Gnome sessions. If not inhibited get Gnome idle time via mutter. If not Gnome get idle time from X\+SS. Note that the fallback strategy here means that essentially for non-\/\+K\+DE non-\/\+Gnome window managers, X\+SS and/or fallback to event\+\_\+detect will be used, which means that idle inhibit functionality will be lost.
\item reports the combined last\+\_\+active\+\_\+time from all of the above (unless it fell back to U\+S\+I\+NG event\+\_\+detect) by writing to the named pipe set up by event\+\_\+detect a short message in the form of timestamp\+:U\+S\+E\+R\+\_\+\+A\+C\+T\+I\+VE, which is received by an asynchronous, non-\/blocking read thread on the event\+\_\+detect side, which does validation on the message to prevent a security risk.
\item optionally can run dc control scripts itself to control dc programs directly based on idle time.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Since event\+\_\+detect receives update last\+\_\+active\+\_\+times from its own sources A\+ND all user level idle\+\_\+detect instances running on the machine, and provides an overall last\+\_\+active\+\_\+time in last\+\_\+active\+\_\+time.\+dat, the B\+O\+I\+NC client or other DC architecture can simply poll the shared memory segment once a second to determine idleness.

This resolves 99\% of the issues we have been having with idle detection. Other specific window manager code can be added later for idle inhibit detection on other than K\+D\+E/\+Gnome.

This should be considered early beta code. It should run stably. Most corner cases have been tested, but installation is still not straightforward.

Development work is occurring on the development branch, and releases are on master. I am currently doing periodic pre-\/release tags (i.\+e. 0.\+x) at significant development points.

\subsubsection*{Installation procedure}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item git clone \href{https://github.com/jamescowens/idle_detect.git}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/jamescowens/idle\+\_\+detect.\+git} and change into the idle\+\_\+detect directory.
\item Make sure you have installed the packages for the dependencies listed above. The actual names will vary depending on the distribution.
\item Compile and install the executables and system level service event\+\_\+detect and config file with sudo ./install.sh. Two arguments can be supplied to install.\+sh\+: --prefix=$<$prefix directory$>$ to change the installation prefix directory from the default of /usr/local/bin, and --cxx-\/compiler=$<$compiler path$>$ to specify the path of a C++-\/17 compliant compiler. Note that the cmake install script run by install.\+sh will do a compile test to ensure the chosen compiler supports the C++-\/17 features used in this code, as some compilers report C++-\/17 compatible and accept the flag, but in fact do not fully implement all parts of the C++-\/17 standard. Gcc-\/7 is a good example.
\item Modify event\+\_\+detect.\+conf to your liking with sudo nano /etc/event\+\_\+detect.conf and if you changed the event\+\_\+detect.\+conf file, reload the service with sudo systemctl restart dc\+\_\+event\+\_\+detection.
\item Install user level script and user level service with ./user\+\_\+install.sh (This is run as your regular user account, not sudo.)
\item Modify idle\+\_\+detect.\+conf to your liking with nano $\sim$/.config/idle\+\_\+detect.\+conf and reload the service with systemctl --user restart dc\+\_\+idle\+\_\+detection.
\item Check the status of both the services\+: sudo systemctl status dc\+\_\+event\+\_\+detection, and systemctl --user status dc\+\_\+idle\+\_\+detection, and make sure they are successfully running.
\item Modify the dc\+\_\+pause and dc\+\_\+unpause scripts to your liking (they are currently set up to control B\+O\+I\+NC in its default installation).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item sudo nano /usr/local/bin/dc\+\_\+pause
\item sudo nano /usr/local/bin/dc\+\_\+unpause
\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If you make subsequent changes to the event\+\_\+detect.\+conf file or the idle\+\_\+detect.\+conf files, then you currently need to restart the appropriate service to pick up the changes.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
